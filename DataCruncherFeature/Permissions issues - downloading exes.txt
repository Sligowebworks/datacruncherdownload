You can use IIS lockdown with URLScan. You will have to
reconfigure the urlscan.* file to permit download of *.exe's for download of
the client. Also, you will need to adjust the NTFS permissions on the sta
directory to permit write and the nfuse icon directory as well. Typically,
there is a deny write to web anonymous and web applications (I think) after
running iislockdown. You will have to disable the permission inheritence.
From IIS administrator, you will want to disable execute access to the Icon
directory and only allow access to the sta directory from the local (to the
server) IP addresses. 


Double check that you do not permit Execute in the MMC in the SCRIPTS VD 
or Folder.
Try this.
Create a new VD.
Map it to a folder with only one .EXE
Set the VD Application Settings (IIS4) or Excute permissions (IIS5) to 
None.
Access the VD from browser using with the filename.exe as the last item 
in the url.
This will work.
The error you are getting means that it is clearly a permissions issue.
