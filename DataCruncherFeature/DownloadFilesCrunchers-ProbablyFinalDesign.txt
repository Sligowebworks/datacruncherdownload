Subject: Wisconsin - summary of the data crunchers download feature 
X-Spam-Checker-Version: SpamAssassin 2.53 (1.174.2.15-2003-03-30-exp) 

I also spoke with Jean about this.....be sure to read down to the very bottom, there are more specifics there.... 


Number of files:
2912 files - 8x13x28
- 7 years + 1 with all years
- 12 CESA + 1 with all CESAs
- 27 questions + 1 with all questions (one of the 28 questions is not a data question - see below)


Format of files - each file contains:

Agency info     1       Year
                2       Org Level 
                3       CESA
                4       District Name
                5       District Number
                6       School Name
                7       School Number
                8       School Type
                9       Agency Type
                10      Agency Key
Student info    11      Grade
                12      Mobility Status (FAY or Not) (will be empty for all non-WKCE files for now)
                13      Student Group #1 (note: can use race/gender instead of student group, if cheaper)
                14      Student Group #2


Each file will have additional "Topic info" columns specific to that question - these should be obvious but we will check with Jean on these as we go along. 

Example - Attendance:

Topic info      15      Enrollment 
                16      Actual Days of Attendance
                17      Possible Days of Attendance
                18      Attendance Rate


- the FAY column - #12 - will be broken out for WKCE only - for now - 

- the "all" option can be done with file bundling, not all one big file necessarily

- any rate that is shown on a page should be included in the data cruncher's version

- can use race/gender instead of student group, if cheaper

- add schooltype, charter schools, agency key?
