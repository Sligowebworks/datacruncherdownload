Subject: Wisconsin - summary of the "download files" link (the 
  simple/light users download feature) 
X-Spam-Checker-Version: SpamAssassin 2.53 (1.174.2.15-2003-03-30-exp) 

I had a long talk with Jean on Friday about this.....be sure to read down to the very bottom, there are more specifics there....

For the light users:
- A "download raw data from this page" link on each page. When the user clicks on it, they're prompted with a standard save-file dialog box. 
- The file is in comma-separated value (CSV) format, which opens into Excel by default and is also easily import-able into any database program. 
- The file contains a friendly version of the data showing in the table on the page - it has additional labels (where necessary) giving district and school names and numbers, so that it will be clear what each row of data is when viewed off-page, e.g., within a spreadsheet. 
- Suppression, aggregations, etc. are all included. 
- It's a small file that contains only data specific to particular view of that page - e.g., if the user wants both gender and race comparisons, they do two different downloads for the two different views of the data. 
- Since the data being downloaded are relatively small, this could all be done in real-time with no need for pre-processed files or restricted download times. 
- The link could go below the table on each page, or anywhere we want. 
- The advantage is that it's fast and friendly - but serious data crunchers will want the next feature... 

preferred order of columns:

cesa number
district number
school number
district name 
school name 
year 
subject name (if any)
male/female (if any)
race (if any)
enrollment (if any)
then remaining data columns - in the same order as what appears in the table


[similar to data crunchers format except put names near data]


if cheap and easy, include these columns: 

schooltype
charter schools 
agency key
