the "download files" link option:

preferred order of columns:

cesa number
district number
school number
district name 
school name 
year 
subject name (if any)
male/female (if any)
race (if any)
enrollment (if any)
then remaining data columns - in the same order as what appears in the table


[similar to data crunchers format except put names near data]


if cheap and easy, include: 

schooltype
charter schools 
agency key




the data crunchers version: 

the "all" option can be done with file bundling, not all one big file necessarily

data crunchers version: any rate that is shown on a page should be included in the data cruncher's version

data crunchers version: can use race/gender instead of student group, if cheaper

data crunchers version: add schooltype, charter schools, agency key?




other notes:

DPI distributes the SPR (Report Card) task by making data available to locals and letting them handle the rest

posting new WKCE results is most important - NCLB

keep tight track of budget - things may get dicey with what the feds require
