In this case, it's likely that WinZip and the self-extractor application
is not being recognized as 'registered' under the account from which the
application is launched.


The reason is due to the fact that it checks HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Nico
Mak Computing\WinZip Self-Extractor\Ver. to see if it exists and is the same
version as the one being run. If it does not exist or is the wrong version,
it goes through the one time install which checks to see if you want it to
be the WinZip self-extractor app, AND it displays the license agreement. The
reason is that it is a per user license not a per machine license.


The VB script may run from the 'system' account.


The simplest solution is to alter the account used by the process.
Using the 'administrator' account not only corrects the problem with
WinZip, but also has more permissions than the system account.


If this is not an option, you'll need to 'manually' log in as the system
account.


To make it work, you can schedule this:


at <now + 1 minute> /interactive cmd.exe /k
(from the Microsoft Knowledge Base Q142040)


When the command prompt window opens, you can manually execute WinZip
and the self-extractor and register for the logged in user.


When using WinZip Self-Extractor's command line on a remote system,
execution can get hung up by a dialog box that appears the first time
for each new user asking for them to agree to the license agreement.  If
there is no convenient way to access the remote machine and dismiss the
dialog box then it can be bypassed by creating a text file called
winzipse.ini containing the following text:


        [WinZipSE]
        Version=2.2


This file should be placed in the same folder as WinZip Self Extractor's
program files.


Please let me know if you have any questions.
