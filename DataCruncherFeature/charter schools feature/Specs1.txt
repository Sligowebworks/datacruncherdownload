See attached.  People in Charter Schools Programs here have money and they
like the fact there is a "charter" field in the download files but don't
like the fact that assessment data (especially the WKCE/WSAS 4, 8, 10) data
are not available in the same way.  


The purpose of this enhancement would be to provide download options and
download data on this page for WSAS like those available for other questions
on WINSS.  


-- design for charter, non-charter, both
-- estimate $$, not hours

start to pitch work for grades 3-8 - avoid "rewrite?" - but still must rebuild everything - just bury the re-write in this....how support grades 3-8 in the pages? it's still a re-write....

If I can get a rough estimate on the WSAS download options checkboxes per
specs I sent then that would be good.  Just ball park +/- a couple of
thousand dollars would be good.   Would that be hard to do?  We can get more
precise later but I need to get back to people on this. 



How did students perform on state tests at grades 4, 8, and 10?

How did students perform on the state reading test at grade 3?

How did performance of all students in my school compare to performance of continuing students only?


itemize every column name for every page, and every topic column
specify grade ranges under grade_label (4,8,10 only)
no schooltypes, no charter
student groups are in rows instead of columns
WSAS: WKCE and WAA Combined vs. WKCE Only - two separate files
similar schools - no?
no private schools except for Milwaukee partnership schools?
WRCT? 
Continuing students? OK to combine with 
105 records per school/district - 99225 rows for CESA 01

no page links?

I just checked this.  I don't get "Page cannot be displayed" any more
but I think what I get now is worse.   Instead I get a message that I
can only select 3 boxes per variable.  This will be very frustrating
because a lot of users will want all CESAs for a single year and a
single question (statewide data), and other users will want all years
for a single question.  Was better the way it was before.  Is there
another alternative?  

PS.  I have a meeting with special ed on Friday about status.  I also
have to get back to folks who want an estimate on the download options
for WSAS stuff (what I sent a few days back).  Just so you know.  How
long do you think before we can get going on special ed stuff (assuming
I can get back to you on remaining download options stuff this weekend)?
How long until I can get an estimate about the other project?

6) Page cannot be displayed.  I still get this message.  Seems to happen
mainly when the number of files being generated is large.  


Michael's working on this now, should be done tonight or tomorrow....
