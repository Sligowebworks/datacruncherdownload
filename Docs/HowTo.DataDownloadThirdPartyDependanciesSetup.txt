Website Root (probably 'online') -- %wwwroot%

***Copy wscript.exe from system32 to %wwwroot%\bin

In %wwwroot%\bin\instalfiles:

*** run winzip90.exe
when prompted, Instal to %wwwroot%\bin\WinZip [2010-01-24 -- installing to D:\Program Files\Winxzip]
Select "Start With WinZip Classic"

***Open WinZip, under help, select "Enter Registration Code"
get license info from file ending in .license.txt

*** Under Options, configuration, folders tab, for "Temp Folder" field enter:
%wwwroot%\data\DataDownload\Zips\

***run wzcline.exe
to instal the command line support add-on to winzip

***run Self-Extractor instal -- wzipse22.exe
again, to %wwwroot%\bin\WinZip Self-Extractor
(if you are copying files from another server, you have to 
delete \\marge\D\WisconsinWebSite\online\bin\WinZip Self-Extractor and re-create it from the install; 
otherwise you won't the "Enter Registration Code" prompt in the next step.)

***Start SE
Click on "Enter Registration Code."
Look in the same license.txt file only further down, you will se the SE license info.
You can then exit the dialogue.
Copy the file winzipse.ini from this instal folder
and place it in the folder where you instaled SE.
This will enable the system user to access WinZipSE from ASP

*** Path to Windows Script Host
Ensure that the WSH executable (wscript.exe) is in the configured strExePath [2010-01-24 -- D:\Program Files]

*** other notes:
if copying from another server:
- set strExePath in ZipScript.vbs if paths change
- probably best to clean out any remaining Zips 
from \\marge\D\WisconsinWebSite\online\data\DataDownload\Zips....

can test things out with \\marge\D\WisconsinWebSite\online\data\DataDownload\Docs\TestZipScript.vbs
